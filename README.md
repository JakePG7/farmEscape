# (2020) Farm Escape - Jake PG
## My first big project; A Python top-scrolling platforming game using the pygame library. 
A very well fleshed-out project considering it was my first! Making the ending animation was quite fun too!

## Playing Instructions
- Run farmescape.py with the pygame library
- Once you start the jump, use the arrow keys to move left and right
- Move to the platforms to continue ascending (You can loop through to the other edge of the screen)
- Collect coins to purchase various avatars (I added the eyes to vegetables from some google image :) )
- The platforms don't dissapear once you jump past them sufficiently, so don't fall!
- Avoid touching the flying knives!
- Saves high scores and purchased skins into a text file
